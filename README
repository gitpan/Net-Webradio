NAME
    Net::Webradio - receive one or more webradio-stations

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::Webradio
      my $receiver = Net::Webradio->new();

      my $station = Net::Webradio::Station::Shoutcast->new();
      $station->host( $server->[0] );
      $station->port( $server->[1] );
      $receiver->add_station( $station ) if  $station->connect( $server->[0], $server->[1] ) ;
  
      while ($receiver->number_of_stations) {
         $receiver->receive();
      }

DESCRIPTION
    Net::Webradio is a framework for receiving one or more
    webradio-stations. All classes are implemented with the so-called
    "template-pattern".

    The module is a multiplexer for one or more
    Net::Webradio::Station-objects (eg Net::Webradio::Station::Shoutcast).

USAGE
    To change the handling of certain events (timeout, disconnect) you have
    to overload some methods. You can also change/overload the
    station-object to change the behaviour of the system.

    You can find one example in the Example/ directory.
